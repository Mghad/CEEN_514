#Memo - What I want to learn in this class

I want to learn how to code. I can code quite well in vba, but that is about it. I really enjoy the coding I have done in vba for school and work, but that has been limited to excel. I want understand how various types of code works together on an app or website, where it is stored, and how to create it. I would consider myself a beginner, and as such am looking to expand my knwledge base and my abilities.

FOr our final project we will need to figure out how to use the Network Analyst tool. I have never used that tool, so it will be a good opporunity to familiarize myself wih something new.
